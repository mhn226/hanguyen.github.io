I'm a PhD student jointly supervised by [Laurent Besacier](http://lig-membres.imag.fr/besacier/) and [Yannick Estève](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/yannick-esteve). I'm interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in general, and Machine Translation (MT) in particular. I forcus mainly on Automatic Speech Translation (AST), and especially Simultaneous Speech Translation.

Most PhD works so far are done in the context of [ON-TRAC project](https://on-trac.univ-avignon.fr/on-trac-consortium/).
